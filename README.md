# Features

Disable mods you don't want to use at the moment, 
and if you want to take it a step further, 
even delete them from your computer.

Drag and drop files into their respective directories. *Like "/mods/" and "/assets/mod_overrides/"*

Easy to access buttons for your game directory and starting the game.

Backup all of your mods and package it into a compressed file.

In the future there will be profiles so stay tuned for that üòÅ

**Like all PAYDAY 2 Mods, [Super BLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz/) is required to run mods**

# Supported Platforms

### Reguarding OS

At the moment this is only supported on windows due to some dependencies
and their features being windows exclusive

### Reguarding Storefront

I only have access to the Steam version,
so I cannot say if it works for Epic Games
without feedback.

# Future Plans

+ Mod Profiles
+ Displaying Mods Better
+ Dark Theme
+ If a .zip is dropped then automatically unzip it
+ Add logging so bug reporting is a lot easier

*Suggestions are appreciated!*

# Contributing

As long as there's an opened issue, please take a look and send a pull request of your contribution!

There are plans to add a CONTRIBUTING.md and maybe even a wiki.

### Things to know when contributing

+ `main.py` is the script that starts the program
+ The program auto-adjusts paths if running via script or EXE
+ Test your code through the EXE before submitting a PR, sometimes code will behave differently.
+ If you want to run the program through the EXE, run `createEXE.bat`
+ Variables that are used throughout the project are stored in `constant_vars.py`
+ Please keep your code formatting consistent with the rest of the project
