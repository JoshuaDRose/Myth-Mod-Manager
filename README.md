# Features

* Disable mods you don't want to use at the moment, and if you want to take it a step further, even delete them from your computer.
    + *This feature is good for testing out which mod is crashing the game!*

* Automatic installation by dragging and dropping files into the program.
    + This also includes automatic unzipping.

    + *You still have to choose what type of mod it is (mods, mod_overrides, maps)*

* Easy to access buttons for your game directory and starting the game.

* Search bar to find the mod you're looking for in seconds

* Backup all of your mods and package it into a compressed file.

In the future there will be profiles so stay tuned for that üòÅ

**Like all PAYDAY 2 Mods, [Super BLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz/) is required to run mods**

# Supported Platforms

### Reguarding OS

At the moment this is only supported on windows due to some dependencies
and their features being windows exclusive

### Reguarding Storefront

I only have access to the Steam version,
so I cannot say if it works for Epic Games
without feedback.

# Download
You may download any version of Myth Mod Manager and view changelogs at the [releases page](https://github.com/Wolfmyths/Myth-Mod-Manager/releases)

# Future Plans

+ Mod profiles
+ Dark Theme
+ .rar drop-install support
+ Improved visuals
+ Some kind of [modworkshop.net](https://modworkshop.net/g/payday-2) integration, see [issue #14](https://github.com/Wolfmyths/Myth-Mod-Manager/issues/14)

*Suggestions are appreciated!*
